SpoofR
SpoofR is an open-source, offline HTML implementation of the classic bluffing game "Spoof." Our goal is to evolve this into a fully web-based, interactive app with support for online tournaments.

We welcome your feedback, ideas, and code contributions! Whether you want to report bugs, suggest features, or help us build the next phase, your support is appreciated.

Features
Play with 2–8 players on a single device

Multiple game modes: "Last Player Wins" or "Last Player Loses"

Customizable escalation triggers and sudden death rounds

No installation or internet connection needed—just open the HTML file in your browser

How to Play
Each player secretly selects 0–3 coins to hold.

Players take turns guessing the total number of coins held by all.

No two players can make the same guess in a round.

After all guesses, coins are revealed.

If a player guesses the total exactly, they are out (safe) for the rest of the game.

The last player remaining is the loser (or winner, depending on the selected mode).
